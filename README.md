# PDF-tables-automatic-program

This project is based on PDFPlumber, aiming to automatically crawl, clean and integrate all tables in PDFs, especially useful for time series data and for tables that can only be recognized as texts but not tables by PDFPlumber. 

### Download All PDFs
1.Put the script and PDFs in a same folder on your Desktop. By simply running the code, folders with names same as PDFs will be created, and tables in PDFs will be in these folders.

2.Have to modify the regular expressions in the code to capture tables you want.


### PDF Integration
Put this script and folders created by Dwonload All PDFs and run the code. same tables in different PDFs will be integrated and will be output in another folder named 'integrated tables' on your Desktop.
